# Mµltiversal-EVOHeart

## Description

A small 2D, grid based projectile figthing game, inspired mainly by "Mega Man Battle Network".

The characters are taken from drawings my good friend XmegaaAAa made, he made a whole universe (the mµltiversal) and this game is a sort of spin-off.

There are currently two person working on the game :

- XmegaaAAa, who does most of the design work and drew the characters
- myself, who implements stuff

I'm using the Bevy game-engine, since Rust is fantastic, and the engine is pretty minimalist so it's fine for a relatively simple game.

## Objectives

- [ ] Get the boiler-plate down
- [ ] Basic terrain navigation
- [ ] Basic physics / collision system for projectiles
- [ ] Menus (minimal viable product)
- [ ] Implement characters
